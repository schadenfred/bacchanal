  welcome_statement: "There are five of us. I’m one of the dads and I have two daughters, Taylor and Ella. My wife, Sarah, is the daughter of our little group’s patriarch, Kurt Schoeneman. Kurt is the owner of the Anderson Valley’s storied Ferrington Vineyard, the source of our fruit. Together, we make up Fathers & Daughters Cellars.
