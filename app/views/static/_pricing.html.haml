          We have a free version that allows you to have a page for your farm, business, or winery. It will always be free, and provide outstanding value, the likes of which have never been seen. But if you choose a paid plan, you are encouraging ice cold new features, the absence tacky advertising, and helping people to know where their food comes from.
